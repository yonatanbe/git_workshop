  * the first: it's just a name for you to identify the search engine. e.g., github code search
  * the second: a keyword that will be used to access this search engine. e.g., github. 
  * the third: use this ```https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&type=Code&q=user:wix %s``` - the github search page with the code section and the wix user.
